									<p>About Me: Hi! My name is Brett Parr and I am a student currently enrolled at BCIT. I have very little web development experience, but I very much enjoy learning more and more about web development and design, as my studies continue. A little about myself: I was born in the small town of Bella Coola, British Columbia. It is a beautiful place on the north coast of BC, a town with a population of about 1500. It has some of the best heliskiing and sport fishing locations in the entire world, two activities I love to do when I am not studying or working. I work, study and live in the lower mainland, in beautiful British Columbia.

								<h1>Rationale</h1>
								
								<p>Designed as a final project for BCIT's COMP 1950 in order to display what we have learned througout the past months. Our Goal was to create something modern and exciting for our users. To achieve our goal we set out with four basic principles in mind.</p>
								
								<div class = "rationalePage">
								<ul>
									<li><h2>Simplicity</h2>
											<p>We achieved this goal by keeping the site on one dynamic page.</p>				
									</li>
									<li><h2>Interaction</h2>
											<p>This site uses Javascript and transitions to help engage the user.</p>
									</li>
									<li><h2>Organization</h2>
											<p>Our layout is designed in a way to give make the site easy for the user to navvigate.</p>
									</li>
								    <li><h2>Cohesion</h2>
										<p>To ensure our site was cohesive, we made sure all of the content was related.</p>
								    </li>
								</ul>

											<a id="lectures"></a>
											<h1>Lecture</h1>
											<p>The Lecture pages provide a place where students can follow and review class lectures. The lecture pages were designed to be visually appealing and easy to navigate.By following our four main principles, we were able to achieve this.</p>

										<h1>Blog</h1>
										<p>In an effort to improve and facilitate communication between students and teachers of COMP 1950, we have created a Tumblr Blog, allowing students to share and post questions and answers.  This is an accesible place to keep users up-to-date on late-breaking news, share interesting articles and post other notices, directly from the lecture page.</p>

									<div class = "lecture_description description3">
										<a id="materials"></a>
										<h1>Materials</h1>
										<p>One improvement we hope to accomplish with this website is creating, organized and userfriendly access to all course materials beyond the lectures in one space.  This avoids bouncing around trying to work backwards to find it all as it is presented. This includes all downloads, exercises, assignments, readings, and resources pursuant to the course.</p>

									<a id="design"></a>
										<h1>Design</h1>
										<p>We wanted to present each page and all of the course information from lectures to resources and exercises in our own unique way but with a cohesive design that aligns with with BCIT's website.  We went with a vary straightforward layout and a very clean look using simple graphics and images. We took our inspiration from some of our favourite sites: apple.com, nait.ca, simplebits.com, and alistapart.com.</p>
